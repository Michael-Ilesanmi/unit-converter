# Units Converter

This is a simple conversion app that converts from one unit to another, with the user specifying the units to be onverted (Kg to Pounds, Kilometres to Miles, etc.,) and inputing the value to be converted.

On clicking the "CONVERT" button, the conversion is immmediately done without reloading the page.

The conversions are done with the use of Javascript, and does not use any server-side requests, as all the conversion formulars have been hardcoded into the script.

Currently, there are 24 possible conversions on this app, and I am still working on adding more conversions to the app soon.

## The Styling

I designed the frontend using CSS Flexbox to center the conversion box on the page. I also made use of Bootstrap v5.0.1 framework.  
The font used is Montserrat and is linked from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/).  
The background image used for the page is a photo by Daniels Joffe (https://unsplash.com/@ydaniels) gotten from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/), you can check out their website for quality free pictures to use for your projects.  
For the page responsiveness, the approach used is a Large Screen first, and a max-width of 660px for the small screen orientation.  
There is not much difference between the small screen and large screen orientation, save for the for the font-size of conversion result, width of the conversion box, and width of the input box.
